They represent perfectly round objects in spaces with any number of dimensions (in mathematical sense, objects with constant positive curvature). Just like a three-dimensional sphere is a perfectly round object, an n-ball retains this characteristic in n-dimensional space. The n-ball is defined by its center point and a radius, which determines the distance from the center to any point on its surface. While it may be challenging to visualize n-balls beyond three dimensions, their study is crucial in mathematics, physics, and computer science, enabling us to understand and analyze complex phenomena in higher-dimensional spaces. In deep learning, it helps in understanding high-dimensional data distributions and defining search spaces."
