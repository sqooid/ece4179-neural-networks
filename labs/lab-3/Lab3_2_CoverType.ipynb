    "\n",
    "The chosen model was the model with 128 hidden neurons.\n",
    "The performance is not great. From the training and test runs, the accuracy was around 43%, so getting 4/5 correct is better than expected. Having less than 50% accuracy is pretty abysmal and not very useful for any sort of automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: Now please provide at least 2-3 suggestions to improve the performance of the shallow MLP, you should support your idea with reasoning or providing results of implementing the idea.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- increase the number of hidden neurons. Solid proof that this improves performance is from the fact that the 1024 neuron model performs better.\n",
    "- increase number of training epochs. From the validation loss and accuracy graphs, it looks like those values have not completely plateaued after 30 epochs, so continuing to train for longer would improve performance.\n"
