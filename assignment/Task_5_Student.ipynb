    "- Speech recognition has a wide range of applications, including Voice-Controlled Systems; Speech recognition is used in voice-controlled systems for controlling smart home devices, navigation systems, and automotive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To perform speech recognition, various techniques and models are used, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Transformer-based models like Wave2Vec2. These models are trained on large datasets of labeled speech data to learn the patterns and features of spoken language.\n",

    "- In this task, we are exploring the task of speech recognition using the Wave2Vec2 model. We preprocess audio data, extract features using the pretrained Wave2Vec2 model, and train a simple MLP model to predict the labels.

You can only submit one time per day for the Kaggle competition and we only take your final CSV submission\n",
