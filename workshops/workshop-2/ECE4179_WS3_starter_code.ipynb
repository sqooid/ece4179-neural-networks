    "\n",
    "Welcome to **ECE4179/5179/6179 Week 3**! Our primary objective in this notebook is to introduce the concept of **logistic regression** and its application in **binary classification**. We will use our knowledge to determine the sentiment of a given text. Sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. The attitude may be his or her judgment or evaluation (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)). Sentiment analysis is widely applied to reviews and social media for a variety of applications, ranging from marketing to customer service. We will show how we can build a sentiment analysis model using a simple linear classifier and a Large Language Model (LLM). How exciting!\n",

    "## Understanding Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a linear classification method for binary problems. To better understand its workings, we start by applying the algorithm to a toy dataset. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the weights and bias**:\n",
    "   - Initialize the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ to small random values or zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute the prediction**:\n",
    "   - For each data point $\\color{pink}{\\big(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\\big)}$, compute the logistic regression's prediction, denoted by $\\color{pink}{\\hat{y}}$, which is determined by the expression \n",
    "   \\begin{align} \n",
    "   \\hat{y}_i = \\sigma\\big(\\mathbf{w}^\\top\\mathbf{x}_i\\big)\\;,\n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "   where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function defined as:\n",
    "   \\begin{align} \n",
    "   \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp{(-x)}}\\;.\n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute the loss**:\n",
    "   - The loss function for logistic regression is the binary cross-entropy loss, given by:\n",
    "   \\begin{align} \n",
    "   \\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m \\Big[ y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}_i) \\Big]\\;,\n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "   where $m$ is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the weights**:\n",
    "   - Underneath, weights are updated using gradient descent. The update rules are:\n",
    "   \\begin{align} \n",
    "   \\mathbf{w} &\\leftarrow \\mathbf{w} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}\\;,\n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "   where $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and the gradients are computed as:\n",
    "   \\begin{align} \n",
    "   \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\mathbf{w}} &= \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m (\\hat{y}_i - y_i) \\mathbf{x}_i\\;.\n",
    "   \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat steps 2 to 4**:\n",
    "   - Continue iterating through steps 2 to 4 until convergence is achieved. This occurs when the change in the loss function is below a certain threshold or a specified number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Toy dataset\n",
    "We will use a toy dataset that consists of two classes, each with two features. The data points are plotted below and as you can see is linearly separable.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored binary classification tasks. Here are the key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression and Decision Boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "We used logistic regression to classify data points and visualized decision boundaries. We learned that a logistic regression model can only classify linearly separable data. Using polynomial features, we can employ logistic regression to classify non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis with GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "We used GPT-2, a language model developed by OpenAI along with a logistic regression model to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. For each review, we tokenized the text data and used the average output of GPT2 as text representation. We trained a logistic regression model on the resulting representations and evaluated the model on the test data and some reviews from the latest movie `Deadpool & Wolverine'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Want to do more?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try using a different language model such as BERT, LLAMA, or Phi-3 for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you use an instruct model, you can also prepare a response to the negative reviews. Certain models in the transformer library have generate method that can be used to generate text. Check this [page](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2) to learn about generating text with GPT2."
